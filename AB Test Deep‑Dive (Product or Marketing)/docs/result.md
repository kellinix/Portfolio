Hypothesis Test

# H₀ (null): Conversion rate of A = Conversion rate of B
# H₁ (alt): Conversion rate of A ≠ Conversion rate of B

1. Statistical Test

Z-statistic: -3.786
P-value: 0.0002

Since p < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.
This means the difference in conversion rates between Group A and Group B is statistically significant.

2. Conversion Rates with Confidence Intervals

Group A (Control): 10.22% (95% CI: 9.39% – 11.06%)
Group B (Variant): 12.63% (95% CI: 11.70% – 13.56%)

The confidence intervals do not overlap much, reinforcing that B’s higher performance is real.

3. Interpretation

Absolute lift: +2.41 percentage points (10.22% → 12.63%)
Relative lift: ~+23.6% increase in conversion rate.

Group B consistently outperformed Group A across devices, countries, and overall.

Conclusion: Rolling out Group B is expected to drive a ~24% increase in conversions compared to Group A.
