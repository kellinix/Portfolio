Observations:

Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn

Customers in the first 12 months are most likely to churn

Electronic check users churn the most

Insight: 
Customers on flexible short-term contracts are far more likely to churn, showing contract length is a major retention lever.
The retention risk is highest in the first year of a customerâ€™s lifecycle, suggesting that onboarding and early engagement are critical.
Customers who set up automatic payments are much less likely to churn, possibly due to reduced friction or higher commitment.

Short-term contracts + new customers + manual payment methods = highest churn risk.
Long-term, loyal customers with auto-pay are significantly more stable.
