SQL Exploration — Customer Churn
1. Churn by Contract Type

Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn (42.7%), which is almost 4x higher than One-year contracts (11.3%) and 15x higher than Two-year contracts (2.8%).

Insight: Customers on flexible short-term contracts are far more likely to churn, showing contract length is a major retention lever.

2. Churn by Tenure Group

New customers (0–12 months) churn the most at 47.4%, nearly 5x higher than long-term customers (49+ months, only 9.5%).

Insight: The retention risk is highest in the first year of a customer’s lifecycle, suggesting that onboarding and early engagement are critical.

3. Churn by Payment Method

Customers paying via Electronic Check churn at 45.3%, while those using automatic payments (bank transfer or credit card) have churn rates below 17%.

Insight: Customers who set up automatic payments are much less likely to churn, possibly due to reduced friction or higher commitment.

Overall Key Patterns

Short-term contracts + new customers + manual payment methods = highest churn risk.

Long-term, loyal customers with auto-pay are significantly more stable.
